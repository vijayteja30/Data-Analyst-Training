 Engine: PostgreSQL
 Joins:
    1. INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
    2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned for the right table.
    3. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the
    left table. If no match, NULLs are returned for the left table.
    4. FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records. If no match, NULLs are returned for the non-matching side.
    5. CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, i.e., every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.
    6. SELF JOIN: A table is joined with itself. This is useful for comparing rows within the same table.

        e.employee_id, 
        e.name, 
        d.department_name 
    FROM 
        employees e 
    INNER JOIN 
        departments d 
    ON 
        e.department_id = d.department_id;
2. 
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id, 
        e.name, 
        d.department_name 
    FROM 
        employees e 
    INNER JOIN 
        departments d 
    WHERE
        e.department_id = d.department_id 
        AND e.salary > 50000;
